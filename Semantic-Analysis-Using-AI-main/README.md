#   DATA ANALYSIS USING ANALYSIS

PROBLEM STATEMENT - " computers compare and ANALYSE text but never identify and compare the MEANING 

------- we have developed a soultion that will take the text and compare it to the inteneded meaning of the text to the compare the data that we have provided-----------


TECH STACK:

it is done using a machine learning cocept called cosine segmentation and binary mapping 

The project is majorly build on python 
Server - we have used th python flask module to host it on the local server (since this is a prototype and not the final product)
Front end- we have used basic HTML CSS and JS as more of our focous is on the backent and making all the functonalities up  and runninh

AI - it is build upon the NLTK framework Natural Launguage Tool Kit 
the AI analizes the meaning behind the text and compares the meaning to the meaning of the test file and returns the similarites and the percentile of similarites

the whole aim of the project is to make the computer understand and then compare the text files 



APPLICATION

 RESEARCH papers

    we have used this application to scrape the data froma an image and also scrape the data from the web to commpare the meaning of 
    different reserch papers and to compare the differences and similarities 
    The AI has a heat value or the sesitivity of the weights that it works on so that it can flag the similar files and it can notify the user 

    we also have created the difference_repor.html to give a veiw for the differences in plain text 
    and the binary values of the repetetion of the data that is given in both the files 

we have used BS4 module for web scrapping to search and provide results from the web

The achived goal of the project


----------------------------- we have been able to compare the (text/files) with their meaning and then we have been able to flag then and notify the user-----------------
